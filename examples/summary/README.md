# 📝 Session Summarization Example

This example demonstrates LLM-driven session summarization integrated with the framework's `Runner` and `session.Service`.

- Preserves original `events`.
- Stores summary separately from events (not inserted as system events).
- Feeds LLM with "latest summary + incremental events since last summary" to keep context coherent without truncation.
- Uses `SessionSummarizer` directly with session service for summarization.

## What it shows

- LLM-based summarization per session turn.
- Simple trigger configuration using event-count threshold.
- Prompt construction that injects the latest summary and recent events.
- Backend-specific persistence:
  - Summary text is stored in `sess.Summaries[filterKey]` for both backends.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later.
- Model configuration (e.g., OpenAI-compatible) via environment variables.

Environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for model service.
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (optional): Base URL for the model API endpoint.

## Run

```bash
cd examples/summary
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
go run main.go -model gpt-4o-mini
```

Quick start with immediate summarization:

```bash
go run main.go -events 0 -tokens 0 -time-sec 0
```

Command-line flags:

- `-model`: Model name to use for both chat and summarization. Default: `deepseek-chat`.
- `-streaming`: Enable streaming mode for responses. Default: `true`.
- `-events`: Event count threshold to trigger summarization. Default: `1`.
- `-tokens`: Token-count threshold to trigger summarization (0=disabled). Default: `0`.
- `-time-sec`: Time threshold in seconds to trigger summarization (0=disabled). Default: `0`.
- `-max-words`: Max summary words (0=unlimited). Default: `0`.
- `-add-summary`: Prepend latest filter summary as system message. Default: `true`.
- `-max-history`: Max history messages when add-summary=false (0=unlimited). Default: `0`.

## Interaction

- Type any message and press Enter to send.
- Type `/exit` to quit the demo.
- Type `/summary` to force-generate a session summary.
- Type `/show` to display the current session summary.
- After the conversation completes, the framework automatically triggers summarization asynchronously in the background.

Example output:

### **Understanding Large Language Models: The AI "Brain" and "Language Master"**

In today's AI revolution, tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Copilot are profoundly changing how we work, learn, and create. Behind all of this lies a core technology driving these innovations—**Large Language Models (LLMs)**. They're not just a hot topic in tech, but a crucial milestone on the path to more general artificial intelligence.

#### **What are Large Language Models?**

Large Language Models are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and predict human language. Think of them as a "super brain" that has read almost all the books, articles, code, and conversations on the internet, learning grammar, syntax, factual knowledge, reasoning patterns, and even different language styles.

## Architecture

```
User → Runner → Agent(Model) → Session Service → SessionSummarizer
                                    ↑
                            Auto-trigger summary
                                    ↓
                            Persist summary text
```

- The `Runner` orchestrates the conversation and writes events.
- The `Runner` automatically triggers summarization asynchronously immediately after each qualifying event is appended via `EnqueueSummaryJob`.
- The `SessionSummarizer` generates summaries using the configured LLM model.
- The `session.Service` stores summary text in its backend storage (in-memory or Redis).
- Summary injection happens automatically in the `ContentRequestProcessor` for subsequent turns.
- You can control summary injection with `-add-summary`.

## Async Summary Configuration

The session service supports asynchronous summary processing by default. The configuration is set in the code with detailed comments:

```go
// In-memory session service with summarizer and async config.
// Async summary processing is enabled by default with the following configuration:
// - 2 async workers: handles concurrent summary generation without blocking
// - 100 queue size: buffers summary jobs during high traffic
// You can adjust these values based on your workload:
//   - Low traffic: 1-2 workers, 50-100 queue size
//   - Medium traffic: 2-4 workers, 100-200 queue size
//   - High traffic: 4-8 workers, 200-500 queue size
sessService := inmemory.NewSessionService(
    inmemory.WithSummarizer(sum),
    inmemory.WithAsyncSummaryNum(2),                // 2 async workers for concurrent summary generation
    inmemory.WithSummaryQueueSize(100),             // Queue size 100 to buffer summary jobs during high traffic
    inmemory.WithSummaryJobTimeout(30*time.Second), // Per-job timeout to avoid long-running LLM calls
)

// Redis service with async config
sessService := redis.NewService(
    redis.WithSummarizer(sum),
    redis.WithAsyncSummaryNum(2),                // 2 async workers for concurrent summary generation
    redis.WithSummaryQueueSize(100),             // Queue size 100 to buffer summary jobs during high traffic
    redis.WithSummaryJobTimeout(30*time.Second), // Per-job timeout to avoid long-running LLM calls
)
```

### Async Configuration Options

- **`WithAsyncSummaryNum(num int)`**: Sets the number of async summary workers. More workers can handle higher concurrency but consume more resources.
- **`WithSummaryQueueSize(size int)`**: Sets the size of the summary job queue. Larger queues can handle more burst traffic but consume more memory.
- **`WithSummaryJobTimeout(timeout time.Duration)`**: Sets a timeout for each async summary job to prevent worker starvation from long-running LLM calls.

### Performance Tuning

- **Low traffic**: Use 1-2 workers with queue size 50-100
- **Medium traffic**: Use 2-4 workers with queue size 100-200
- **High traffic**: Use 4-8 workers with queue size 200-500

## Prompt Customization

You can customize the summary prompt to control how conversations are summarized. The prompt supports placeholders that will be replaced with actual values during summary generation:

### Available Placeholders

- **`{conversation_text}`**: The conversation content to be summarized
- **`{max_summary_words}`**: The maximum word count for the summary (only included when `WithMaxSummaryWords` is set). In the default prompt, this placeholder is replaced with a natural instruction like "Please keep the summary within 100 words." In custom prompts, it's replaced with just the number, allowing you to control the wording in your preferred language.

### Example Usage

```go
// Custom prompt focusing on key decisions
summary.WithPrompt("Summarize this conversation focusing on key decisions: {conversation_text}")

// Custom prompt for technical discussions
summary.WithPrompt("Extract technical insights from this conversation: {conversation_text}")

// Custom prompt for concise summaries
summary.WithPrompt("Provide a brief summary of this conversation: {conversation_text}")

// Custom prompt with length limit (English)
summary.WithPrompt("Summarize this conversation in no more than {max_summary_words} words: {conversation_text}")

// Custom prompt with length limit (Chinese)
summary.WithPrompt("请将以下对话总结为不超过{max_summary_words}个字的摘要：{conversation_text}")

// Custom prompt with length limit (mixed language)
summary.WithPrompt("请总结以下对话，控制在{max_summary_words}字以内：{conversation_text}")
```

## Summary Options

The `SessionSummarizer` supports various configuration options to customize summarization behavior:

### Basic Options

- **`WithMaxSummaryWords(maxWords int)`**: Sets the maximum word count for generated summaries. When set to 0 (default), no word limit is applied. The word limit is included in the prompt to guide the model's generation rather than truncating the output.

- **`WithPrompt(prompt string)`**: Customizes the prompt template used for summary generation. The prompt must include the `{conversation_text}` placeholder. See the [Prompt Customization](#prompt-customization) section for details and examples.

### Trigger Options

- **`WithEventThreshold(eventCount int)`**: Triggers summarization when the number of events exceeds the threshold.

- **`WithTokenThreshold(tokenCount int)`**: Triggers summarization when the estimated token count exceeds the threshold (0=disabled).

- **`WithTimeThreshold(interval time.Duration)`**: Triggers summarization when the time elapsed since the last event exceeds the interval (useful for periodic summarization in long-running sessions).

### Composite Trigger Options

- **`WithChecksAny(checks ...Checker)`**: Triggers summarization when ANY of the provided checks pass (OR logic).

- **`WithChecksAll(checks ...Checker)`**: Triggers summarization when ALL of the provided checks pass (AND logic).

### Example Usage

```go
// Basic configuration
sum := summary.NewSummarizer(model,
    summary.WithMaxSummaryWords(500),
    summary.WithEventThreshold(10),
)

// Complex trigger configuration
sum := summary.NewSummarizer(model,
    summary.WithMaxSummaryWords(1000),
    summary.WithChecksAny(
        summary.CheckEventThreshold(5),
        summary.CheckTokenThreshold(1000),
        summary.CheckTimeThreshold(5*time.Minute),
    ),
)

// Custom prompt
sum := summary.NewSummarizer(model,
    summary.WithPrompt("Summarize this conversation focusing on key decisions: {conversation_text}"),
    summary.WithEventThreshold(3),
)
```

## Key design choices

- Do not modify or truncate original `events`.
- Do not insert summary as an event. Summary is stored separately.
- Session service handles incremental processing for summarization automatically.
- Default trigger uses an event-count threshold aligned with Python (`>` semantics).
- Summary generation is asynchronous by default (non-blocking) with configurable worker pools.
- Summary injection into LLM prompts is automatic and implicit.

## Files

- `main.go`: Interactive chat with manual summary commands and automatic background summarization.

## Notes

- If the summarizer is not configured, the service logs a warning and skips summarization.
- No fallback summaries by string concatenation are provided. The system relies on the configured LLM.
